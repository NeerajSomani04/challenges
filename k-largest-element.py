Question: Design an algorithm for computing the k-th largest element in a sequence of elements. 
It should run in O(n) expected time where n is the length of the sequence, which is not known in advnance.
The value of K is known in advance. Your algorithm should print the k-th largest element after the sequence has ended.
It should use O(k) additional storage
